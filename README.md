IR sensors are electronic devices that can detect and measure infrared radiation in their surrounding environment.
 
They are used in a wide range of applications, from  object detection and distance measurement to temperature sensing and motion detection.

IR Sensor Working Principle
- The sensor contains an IR
emitter and a receiver,
which are placed in close
proximity to each other.

- IR sensors work on the
principle of detecting
infrared radiation emitted
by objects in their
surrounding
environment.

- The sensor then converts
the detected IR radiation
into an electrical signal,
which can be processed
to provide information
about the object.

- The emitter emits IR
radiation, which is
reflected by objects in the
environment and
detected by the receiver.

chalanges faced : 

1- Interference from ambient IR radiation, which
can affect the accuracy of the sensor

2- Limited range and field of view, which can
restrict their use in certain applications

3- High cost compared to some other types of
sensors
